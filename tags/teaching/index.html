                <p>This might come off as <em>yet another developer ranting against java</em>, so let me state this before even stating my goal today: <strong>I think java is a neat language which shows off some good ideas that have clearly influenced the programming community for the past years</strong>.
But, as highly as I think of java as a kinda good designed product and harbinger of very nice things, like the java virtual machine (cradle of fine languages like <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">scala</a> and <a href="http://clojure.org/">clojure</a>)and the widespread use of just-in-time compilation, I consider that teaching it as a first programming language is harmful, because in teaching it you have two choices: either delve into thorough and sometimes hard explanations as to why things have to be done the way they're done or resort to <em>magical</em> explanations: &quot;write it like that because I say so&quot;. And both have equally pejorative consequences: the former leaves little time to teach the fundamentals of programming, like control flow, functions, recursion, environments/computational objects, logic and testing; and the latter sets a rather weak foundation which dooms the future of future engineers/computer scientists. </p>
