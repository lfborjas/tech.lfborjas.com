                <p>When working with third-party services, one is more likely than not to end up parsing
a JSON document. For well-behaved APIs, documentation and examples are available, so the job
usually becomes some minor variation of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reach for the &quot;canonical&quot; JSON parsing library in your language</li>
<li>Grab some example JSON and do some ad-hoc parsing of the bits you're interested in,</li>
<li>Maybe write a class/type/module/namespace to immortalize adapting said JSON data to your domain, hopefully with accompanying tests.</li>
<li>Think everything is okay, until some live data comes in with missing keys (or extra keys!) inconsistent types (nulls where they promised they wouldn't show up, invalid date
formats, etc.)</li>
<li>Go back to step 2 with the newfound edge cases, adapt.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes it's a quick process: couple of caveats you missed in the documentation, sometimes
it's painstaking; the ability to close the loop in a fast, but robust, manner becomes invaluable: you don't want to spend days, and a lot of boilerplate, only to discover that some deep details didn't really work out. I believe a good type system and a good parser help a lot, but the last mile is all about the &quot;getting to the bits of data relevant to your domain.&quot; Optics are my tool of choice for that.</p>

                <p>As part of my astrological forays, I built <a href="https://github.com/lfborjas/almanac">a little library</a> that can traverse an interval of time and find significant events (changes in moon phase, a planet going retrograde/direct, ingresses into zodiac signs,
transits, eclipses.) The data produced is necessarily verbose: you get back a sequence
of events, and each type of event carries information about itself; in some cases,
said information can be composed of further complex data (e.g. a Transit can tell you
all the phases of application/separation it goes through in the interval, and each phase has a beginning and end.) To have to go through a sequence like this and
pattern match and deconstruct in different ways depending on your use case seemed like a lot of <em>annoying boilerplate</em> that I, as a library author, could do better to help with than to just give you the types to pattern match, some good names, and a firm handshake. 
And this is when I realized what's so great about a popular, albeit intimidating, concept in the Haskell ecosystem: <strong>optics</strong>: the ability to build greatly upon &quot;cheap&quot; abstractions.</p>

                <p>In the past year of <em>not</em> updating this blog, even though I said I would, I've been quite busy
shaving yaks: in addition to the apocalypse, house work, and my day job, my wife and I have been
working on a little Jungian-oriented astrology app with an accompanying Haskell backend. 
This has meant a surprising amount of new terrain to traverse, and I'll try to jot down some 
of the highlights here: I've gone from
the depths of C memory tomfoolery, to the heights of actually reading some books and papers on category
theory, passing through the vast fields of Haskell type level programming. I'll try to cover a bit more breadth than depth in a couple of &quot;stories&quot; from the Haskell trenches.</p>
