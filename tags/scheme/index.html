                <p>In the weekends I like to learn lisp (my favorite lisp is scheme), and, whilst I do it in a chaotic fashion, I end up actually learning. Today I'm reading about continuations, a theme that is mentioned over and over in schemeland and which I hadn't the guts to try and understand. Until I found <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme-Z-H-15.html#node_chap_13">this chapter</a> in the book <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme.html">&quot;Teach yourself scheme in fixnum days&quot;</a>. As eye-opening as it is, what I found most surprising is that ruby also has continuation! So I'll sum up what I learned about continuations using ruby for the examples. <strong>All the examples and content are either paraphrased or taken directly from the above book</strong>.</p>

                <p>This might come off as <em>yet another developer ranting against java</em>, so let me state this before even stating my goal today: <strong>I think java is a neat language which shows off some good ideas that have clearly influenced the programming community for the past years</strong>.
But, as highly as I think of java as a kinda good designed product and harbinger of very nice things, like the java virtual machine (cradle of fine languages like <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">scala</a> and <a href="http://clojure.org/">clojure</a>)and the widespread use of just-in-time compilation, I consider that teaching it as a first programming language is harmful, because in teaching it you have two choices: either delve into thorough and sometimes hard explanations as to why things have to be done the way they're done or resort to <em>magical</em> explanations: &quot;write it like that because I say so&quot;. And both have equally pejorative consequences: the former leaves little time to teach the fundamentals of programming, like control flow, functions, recursion, environments/computational objects, logic and testing; and the latter sets a rather weak foundation which dooms the future of future engineers/computer scientists. </p>
