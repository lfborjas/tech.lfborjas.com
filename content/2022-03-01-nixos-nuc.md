I recently got a NUC 11 kit, got a [Samsung SSD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GLX7TNT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) 
and [quite a bit of RAM](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FBNQXC4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), wanted to follow [the official guide](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation-summary) to
installing NixOS 21.11 from a USB flash drive, but I ran into a few snags, especially when doing the partitioning of the drive.

## Booting

The NUC (at least version 11,) defaults to Secure Boot. If you're trying to boot from a "live CD" [in a USB stick](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation-additional-notes), it will error out with a "secure boot violation."
This can be disabled from the graphical configuration interface that comes up when pressing `F2` as the computer boots and following [these steps as documented by Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000038401/intel-nuc/intel-nuc-kits.html)

## Partitioning the SSD

NixOS recommends 512MB for the boot partition, 8GB for swap and the rest for the main partition. I didn't want to stray from that even though I have a 1TB disk
and 32GB RAM (which [some sources say should be given up to 38GB swap](https://itsfoss.com/swap-size/), even then the commands in the [installation summary](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/index.html#sec-installation-summary) seems to miss
a few things for these kinds of disks. 

Creating the main partition went as documented by NixOS:

```sh
# parted /dev/sda -- mklabel gpt
# parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary 512MiB -8GiB
```

However, when creating the the swap partition, I got the `not aligned` warning [someone else found](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/following-install-gave-warning-the-resulting-partition-is-not-properly-aligned-for-best-performance/5335);
just as the [Arch Linux wiki warns](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Parted#Warnings), the alignment depends on the sector size, so one can't just say "start
this partition at 8 GiB from the end" because that may not align depending on the sector size (in my case, 2048s.) I didn't want to "approximate" using percentage points
as the aforementioned nixos ticket says, potentially losing some swap size. Fortunately, I found this [rando post](https://blog.hqcodeshop.fi/archives/273-GNU-Parted-Solving-the-dreaded-The-resulting-partition-is-not-properly-aligned-for-best-performance.html)
that does a deeper dive into this issue... except that the post was useless for my particular issue (a swap partition, not the main partition...) however, [a _comment_ 
in the post](https://blog.hqcodeshop.fi/archives/273-GNU-Parted-Solving-the-dreaded-The-resulting-partition-is-not-properly-aligned-for-best-performance.html#c2166) gave me what I needed:

> it internally generates a range of acceptable values. This range is centered on the value you specify, and extends equally on both sides by half the unit size you used
> Since optimal alignment typically seems to be 1MiB-aligned, the K and M units will often not have sufficient room to reach optimal alignment. Specifying positions in G should have plenty room, but % is usually also fine.

So, the swap partition command in my case worked (with no warnings and no problems for the next step, the boot partition: )

```sh
# parted /dev/sda -- mkpart swap linux-swap -8GB 100%
```

Literally, just say `8GB` instead of `8GiB` to let `parted` figure out exactly where to start the partition between `7.5GB` and `8.5GB` instead of trying to force it to
start at exactly 8GiB. Note also that I gave the partition the label `swap`, instead of `primary`, which it seems is [a mistake in the current nixos documentation](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/161903)

The remaining commands (reproduced below) work just as documented, as well as the rest of the guide.

```sh
# parted /dev/sda -- mkpart ESP fat32 1MiB 512MiB
# parted /dev/sda -- set 3 esp on
```

## Customizing the config

I'm trying to get XMonad going alongside a few things similar to what [`gvolpe` is using out there](https://github.com/gvolpe/nix-config), will update this post as
that progresses!
